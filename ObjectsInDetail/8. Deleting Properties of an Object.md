## Deleting Properties of an Object
To delete a property from an object, you use the delete operator. 

**You can**
  * delete a property of an instance if the property is an own property of that instance.

**You cannot:**
  * delete properties that were inherited, 
  * delete properties with their attributes set to configurable.
  * delete properties of the global object, which were declared with the var keyword.
  
**You must** 
  * delete the inherited properties on the prototype object (where the properties were defined). 

**The delete operator returns true**
  * if the delete was successful. 
  * if the property to delete was nonexistent or the property could not be deleted (such as non-configurable or not owned by the object).

```javascript
var christmasList = {mike:"Book", jason:"sweater" }
​delete christmasList.mike; // deletes the mike property​
​
chistmasList.mike; // undefined
​// The mike property was deleted​
​
​delete christmasList.toString; // returns true, but toString not deleted because it is an inherited method​
​
​// Here we call the toString method and it works just fine—wasn’t deleted ​
christmasList.toString(); //"[object Object]"​
```
