# JavaScript Objects in Detail

## Deleting Properties of an Object
To delete a property from an object, you use the delete operator. You cannot delete properties that were inherited, nor can you delete properties with their attributes set to configurable. 
You must delete the inherited properties on the prototype object (where the properties were defined). 
Also, you cannot delete properties of the global object, which were declared with the var keyword.

The delete operator returns true if the delete was successful. 
And surprisingly, it also returns true if the property to delete was nonexistent or the property could not be deleted (such as non-configurable or not owned by the object).
